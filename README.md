# "Oczko" game

Project is a pure front-end based multiplayer hot-seat game. 

## Adding it to your website

To add a game to your website all you need is a div with a class "game" anywhere on your website. Should it be a fullscreen version or just a minigame on a sidepanel of your webpage - it is up to you.
In order to put the game on your website you need to take three steps:
1) Download and copy the game.js file into your project folder.
2) Make a div (or any other element, such as footer or aside),
3) Execute script on your website.

## Plans for further development
1) Adding computer player automatically in case of starting the game with just one player. The whole idea is based on simple script, that makes "AI" player check when 17 points are already on the table, except for - statistically - 10-20% of decisions, when "AI" player would risk drawing another card - just like a human player would.
2) Adding mechanism showing current hand of an active player alone.
3) Adding card backs graphics for every player to know how many cards other players have.
4) Adding information "pop-up" generator to show who is the winner.
